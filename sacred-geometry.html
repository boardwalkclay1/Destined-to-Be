    <h1>Sacred Geometry &amp; Numerology</h1>
    <p>
      Sacred geometry is the study of how shapes, patterns, and proportions express the same energies that
      numerology describes with numbers. This section shows you how each core number (1–9) connects to specific
      geometric forms, so you can actually <strong>see</strong> your numbers as living symbols—not just digits.

  <section id="sg-basics">
    <h2>What is sacred geometry?</h2>
    <p>
      Sacred geometry is the idea that certain shapes and proportions—like circles, triangles, squares, spirals,
      and the patterns they create—carry specific energies and meanings. These forms show up in nature (shells,
      flowers, crystals, galaxies), in ancient temples, and in spiritual diagrams across cultures. They are
      considered “sacred” because they reveal an underlying order to reality, not because of any one religion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Numerology looks at the <strong>vibration of numbers</strong>. Sacred geometry looks at the
      <strong>vibration of shapes</strong>. When you combine them, each number is not just a concept—it becomes
      a <strong>shape you can visualize, meditate on, and design with</strong>.

  <!-- 2. Core shapes & meanings -->
  <section id="sg-core-shapes">
    <h2>Core sacred shapes and what they mean</h2>

    <article>
      <h3>Circle — unity, soul, wholeness</h3>
      <p>
        The circle has no beginning and no end. It represents unity, infinity, the soul, and the unbroken field
        of consciousness. In sacred geometry, it is often the first shape drawn: everything else is constructed
        from or within the circle. In numerology, the circle resonates strongly with the idea of
        <strong>completion and potential</strong>, especially connected to 0 and 9. 
      </p>
    </article>

    <article>
      <h3>Line — direction, will, path</h3>
      <p>
        A straight line is the simplest expression of movement from one point to another. A
        <strong>vertical line</strong> symbolizes will, aspiration, and connection between “above” and “below.”
        A <strong>horizontal line</strong> symbolizes stability, rest, and the plane of everyday life. In
        numerology, lines are especially relevant to numbers like 1 (will, direction) and 7 (cutting through to
        truth).
      </p>
    </article>

    <article>
      <h3>Triangle — action, fire, manifestation</h3>
      <p>
        The triangle is the first stable polygon: three points define a plane. It is associated with fire,
        will, and the process of manifestation—bringing spirit into form. Pointing upward, it often represents
        aspiration and rising energy; pointing downward, it can represent receptivity or grounding. Triangles
        connect strongly with numbers like 3 (expression, creativity) and 9 (spiritual completion and
        transcendence). 
      </p>
    </article>

    <article>
      <h3>Square — structure, earth, foundation</h3>
      <p>
        The square has four equal sides and four right angles. It is linked to the four directions, four
        elements, and the idea of order, boundaries, and systems. In numerology, this resonates with the energy
        of <strong>4</strong>: discipline, practicality, and building something that lasts.
      </p>
    </article>

    <article>
      <h3>Spiral — growth, evolution, unfolding</h3>
      <p>
        Spirals appear in shells, hurricanes, galaxies, and plant growth. They represent expansion, learning,
        and the way life unfolds in cycles rather than straight lines. In numerology, spirals echo the energy
        of <strong>3</strong> (creative expression) and <strong>5</strong> (change and movement), where life
        doesn’t repeat exactly—it evolves. 
      </p>
    </article>

    <article>
      <h3>Infinity loop (lemniscate) — cycles, power, flow</h3>
      <p>
        The sideways figure-eight symbol represents endless flow: giving and receiving, cause and effect,
        inhale and exhale. It is a powerful symbol of sustained energy and balance. In numerology, it aligns
        closely with <strong>8</strong>: power, manifestation, and the ability to manage cycles of gain and
        loss.
      </p>
    </article>

  <!-- 3. Numbers 1–9 as geometry -->
  <section id="sg-numbers-1-9">
    <h2>Numbers 1–9 as sacred geometry</h2>
    <p>
      Below, each core numerology number (1–9) is paired with a primary geometric form. This doesn’t replace
      traditional numerology meanings—it <strong>visualizes</strong> them. You can use these shapes as icons,
      meditation symbols, or design elements in your numerology app.
    </p>

    <!-- 1 -->
    <article id="sg-1">
      <h3>1 — The Line &amp; Pillar</h3>
      <p><strong>Core geometry:</strong> vertical line, pillar, spear.</p>
      <p>
        In numerology, 1 is about individuality, leadership, and initiation. Geometrically, this is the
        <strong>vertical line</strong>: a direct, uncompromising movement from point A to point B. It is the
        “I” that stands upright. When you visualize your 1 energy, imagine a strong pillar or staff planted in
        the ground—clear direction, no hesitation.
      </p>
      <p>
        In your emoji symbol, this becomes a bold vertical bar, often supported by a base shape (like a soft
        triangle) to show that leadership needs grounding, not just willpower.
      </p>
    </article>

    <!-- 2 -->
    <article id="sg-2">
      <h3>2 — The Vesica &amp; Dual Arcs</h3>
      <p><strong>Core geometry:</strong> two intersecting circles, dual arcs, vesica piscis.</p>
      <p>
        2 is partnership, sensitivity, and duality. In sacred geometry, one of the most important forms linked
        to 2 is the <strong>vesica piscis</strong>: the almond-shaped area where two circles overlap. It
        symbolizes relationship, the space where “you” and “other” meet. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Your emoji version simplifies this into two soft, mirrored arcs—like two parentheses facing each other.
        This captures the feeling of two energies curving toward one another, listening, reflecting, and
        sharing space. If 1 is a straight line, 2 is the first curve: it bends to connect.
      </p>
    </article>

    <!-- 3 -->
    <article id="sg-3">
      <h3>3 — The Triangle &amp; Spiral</h3>
      <p><strong>Core geometry:</strong> triangle, spiral, triple rhythm.</p>
      <p>
        3 is creativity, communication, and expression. In number symbolism, 3 is often linked to the
        <strong>triangle</strong>—three points forming a stable but dynamic shape: beginning, middle, end;
        body, mind, spirit. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The spiral adds motion to that idea: instead of a static triangle, the spiral shows creativity
        unfolding, stories being told, ideas expanding. Your emoji symbol as a bold spiral with a small flick
        at the end captures this: energy that starts inside and moves outward into the world as art, words, or
        performance.
      </p>
    </article>

    <!-- 4 -->
    <article id="sg-4">
      <h3>4 — The Square &amp; Gate</h3>
      <p><strong>Core geometry:</strong> square, rectangle, grid.</p>
      <p>
        4 is stability, structure, and discipline. Geometrically, this is the <strong>square</strong>: four
        equal sides, four corners, four directions. It’s the blueprint, the foundation, the “box” that holds
        things together. In many traditions, 4 is associated with the material world and practical work.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your emoji symbol uses a rounded square frame with a gap at the top. This keeps the meaning accurate:
        strong boundaries and systems, but not a prison. It’s a <strong>gate</strong>—you build structure so
        energy can move through it, not get stuck inside it.
      </p>
    </article>

    <!-- 5 -->
    <article id="sg-5">
      <h3>5 — The Crossroads &amp; Star</h3>
      <p><strong>Core geometry:</strong> crossing lines, pentagram, dynamic center.</p>
      <p>
        5 is change, freedom, and adventure. In sacred geometry and symbolism, 5 is often linked to the
        <strong>pentagram</strong> (five-pointed star) and the human form (head, two arms, two legs), as well
        as the five senses. It represents a dynamic, living center that moves and explores. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Your emoji symbol expresses this as a bold X (crossroads) with an open V beneath it (a path). The X
        shows multiple directions and choices; the V shows that after chaos and options, you still choose a
        direction and move. If your chart has strong 5 energy, you’re meant to learn through motion, risk, and
        experience—not staying in one fixed pattern.
      </p>
    </article>

    <!-- 6 -->
    <article id="sg-6">
      <h3>6 — The Circle &amp; Cradle</h3>
      <p><strong>Core geometry:</strong> circle, womb, container.</p>
      <p>
        6 is care, responsibility, and nurturing. Geometrically, this is the <strong>circle as a container</strong>:
        a space that holds, protects, and includes. In many systems, 6 is associated with home, family, and
        service—being the one who holds things together emotionally.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your emoji symbol is a thick circle with a line dropping from the bottom, like a tether or handle. The
        circle is the caring field; the line is the commitment that grounds that care into real-world action:
        showing up, supporting, maintaining. If you have strong 6 energy, your sacred geometry is literally a
        <strong>cradle</strong>.
      </p>
    </article>

    <!-- 7 -->
    <article id="sg-7">
      <h3>7 — The Blade &amp; Descent Line</h3>
      <p><strong>Core geometry:</strong> horizontal line plus diagonal “cut”.</p>
      <p>
        7 is analysis, introspection, and spiritual inquiry. It’s the number of the seeker, the researcher, the
        one who looks beneath the surface. In sacred geometry terms, this is like a line of ordinary reality
        being <strong>cut through</strong> by a deeper investigation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your emoji symbol shows this as a thick horizontal line (the known world) with a diagonal line dropping
        from the right side (the descent into depth). It looks like a blade or a beam cutting downward. If 4
        builds the structure, 7 asks, “What’s really behind this?” and slices into the hidden layers.
      </p>
    </article>

    <!-- 8 -->
    <article id="sg-8">
      <h3>8 — The Infinity Loop &amp; Tower</h3>
      <p><strong>Core geometry:</strong> infinity symbol, vertical channel.</p>
      <p>
        8 is power, manifestation, and mastery of cycles—especially around money, influence, and long-term
        results. The classic geometric symbol for this is the <strong>infinity loop</strong> (lemniscate): a
        continuous flow of energy looping back on itself. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Your emoji symbol stacks this infinity loop on top of a vertical line. The loop shows the ongoing
        cycles of gain and loss, effort and reward; the line shows that you can channel that flow in a specific
        direction. If you carry strong 8 energy, your sacred geometry is about learning to manage power and
        flow, not just chase it.
      </p>
    </article>

    <!-- 9 -->
    <article id="sg-9">
      <h3>9 — The Circle &amp; Ascending Triangle</h3>
      <p><strong>Core geometry:</strong> circle plus upward triangle.</p>
      <p>
        9 is completion, wisdom, and transcendence. It’s the end of a cycle and the point where experience
        turns into compassion and insight. Geometrically, this is a <strong>circle</strong> (the full cycle)
        combined with an <strong>upward-pointing triangle</strong> (ascension, rising energy).
      </p>
      <p>
        Your emoji symbol shows a thick circle with a rounded triangle above it, slightly overlapping. The
        message is clear: enlightenment doesn’t float above life—it <strong>emerges from</strong> lived
        experience. If you have strong 9 energy, your sacred geometry is a flame rising from a completed world:
        you’re here to finish things, release them, and lift others up.

  <!-- 4. How to use this in your life -->
  <section id="sg-how-to-use">
    <h2>How to use sacred geometry for your own numbers</h2>
    <p>
      Once you know your key numerology numbers (like Life Path, Destiny, Soul Urge, Personality), you can
      assign each one its <strong>geometric form</strong> from above. For example:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Life Path 1:</strong> meditate on the pillar symbol when you need clarity and courage.</li>
      <li><strong>Life Path 4:</strong> draw the square gate when you’re building routines or systems.</li>
      <li><strong>Life Path 5:</strong> visualize the crossroads when you’re choosing between options.</li>
      <li><strong>Life Path 8:</strong> use the infinity tower when working with money, power, or long-term goals.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      You can also use these shapes as <strong>emoji-style icons</strong> throughout your app: next to each
      number, in headers, or as buttons that open deeper explanations. Over time, users will start to
      <strong>recognize their numbers by shape</strong>, not just by name—which makes the experience more
      intuitive and memorable.
